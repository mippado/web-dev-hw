3. For this assignment I first thought about what I would want to make a website about. I love to fly fish and would love to start my own company one day, so that is what I went with. I had to begin by adding my title, and content I wanted with my title, logo, pages and description. From there I used css to get everything to look the way I wanted. It is a simple layout but I think that it looks nice and professional.
