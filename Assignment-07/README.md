The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code.

Alt text is a tenet of accessible web design. Its original (and still primary) purpose is to describe images to visitors who are unable to see them.

My work cycle for this project was more difficult than a lot of the previous projects. I had to insert the files that I downloaded from moodle into a media file and extract them to my index for my copyright section on this page. I also found out that you can find code from youtube videos and soundcloud songs to plug them into your page. I really liked this assignment because I really wanted to learn how to insert media to my pages. It was interesting to learn how much code you can find and use online, there are a lot of ways to get media / information on to your web page!
