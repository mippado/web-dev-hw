      <h2>Blackfoot</h2>

      <p>Breath taking scenery, endless miles of recreation, and countless<br>
        numbers hungry fish make the Blackfoot River a premier fly fishing<br>
        destination. Beginning with the confluence of the North Fork near Ovando, MT,<br>
        and flowing into the Clark Fork River just a few miles outside of Missoula,<br>
        the Blackfoot did not gain its extreme popularity until the block buster movie,<br>
        A River Run's Through It was released in 1992. This movie convinced fly fishermen<br>
        from around the world to visit the Blackfoot river, and from then on out the<br>
        Blackfoot has been regarded as one of the most ideal fly fishing locations in the<br>
        world. There are opportunities for anglers of all skill levels on the Blackfoot as<br>
        the fish are not picky, and will readily eat the largest fly in your box on any<br>
        given day. While the epic streamer fishing and world famous salmonfly hatch are the<br>
        main talking points of the Blackfoot, there are prolific mayfly hatches, caddis<br>
        hatches, and a wide variety of terrestrials that fill the bellies of our trout.</p>
