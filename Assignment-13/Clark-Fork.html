      <h2>Clark Fork</h2>

      <p>Paralleling I-90 for most of it's length, the Clark Fork River is one of the longest rivers in Montana flowing<br>
        more than 280 miles through every kind of terrain imaginable. Beginning near Deer Lodge, Mt, the Clark Fork gains<br>
        size and flow as it passes through the heart of downtown Missoula with the influx of the Bitterroot, Blackfoot,<br>
        and Rock Creek adding mass to the river. The Clark Fork is broken into two distinct sections known as the 'Upper Clark'<br>
        referring to the section of river above Missoula, and the 'Lower Clark' referring to the section of river downstream<br>
        of Missoula. The Upper Clark is smaller and home to a higher population brown trout who love to chase streamers and<br>
        crush terrestrials. On the Lower Clark, massive pods of rainbows and cutthroat are ready to eat a finely presented<br>
        tiny dry fly. These two totally different fisheries offer a lifetime of fishing opportunity all within one large river<br>
        that completes Missoula.</p>
