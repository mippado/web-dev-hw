1. I learned a lot about web development on this project. I finally sped up my command process so I could see the changes on my live site much faster. I think that w3schools.com provides an awesome database of information for people to plug anything they want into their codes. It is also beneficial to see their examples and compare my site to theirs.
2. I don't know if I learned anything new about web design, but I thought it was fun to mess around with different colors and fonts etc to see what looked best for my website. For a fishing page I thought dull colors worked the best and it helped make my colorful pictures standout more.
3. My work cycle for this assignment was simple because I used the same layout that I used for Assignment 12, which I wrongly thought was to make our own website initially. With the layout already done, I plugged information and pictures into the website to make it have the content I wanted in it. I would really like to start a blog or a website of my own at some point that is also based on fly fishing Montana, so this was a super fun project and class as a whole for me. I honestly learned more in this online course than I did in any of my other classes. I think this will benefit me a lot in the future and I cannot wait to see what else I do with coding. This was a great entry course.
