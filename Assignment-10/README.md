1. System fonts are those already installed on your local device and system.
Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server.
Web-safe fonts are fonts that developers can count on being available by the system.

2. It is important to have fallback fonts incase you mis-spell the font you were wanting to use in the first place, or if the browser cannot load this font for whatever reason.

3. My work cycle for this assignment depended heavily on the walk through video. I really liked Professor Evans' layout so I went with her same colors. When thinking about what text I wanted to use, I was fishing earlier today so naturall I figured I should use something fishing related. I went with one of Norman Maclean's most famous quotes from the book and movie 'A River Runs Through it'.
