1. My imaginary client was someone who loves fishing in the Missoula area and wants to document / share their experiences with other people. The website is simple to read and use with just a few pages and pictures. It will be very easy for my client to edit as well.

2. display: inline-block brought a new way to create side by side boxes that collapse and wrap properly depending on the available space in the containing element.
 display: block is where a line break happens after the element, so a block element doesnâ€™t sit next to other elements.
 with display: inline, top and bottom margins & paddings are not respected

 3. My work cycle for this assignment was fun, but I had to go back on the website to find tools to link my pages and import pictures and everything like that.
