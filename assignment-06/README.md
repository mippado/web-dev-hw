I have came across a lot of forms while surfing the web, especially while shopping online. Usually they are used to gather customer information or receive feedback.


-Examples of text include plain text, passwords, text input, max length, placeholders, etc. This text can be used on forms so that customers or page visitors can respond with text of their own.
-Examples of Selection include selection input, radio buttons, checkbox elements and dropdown select. These are used to give page viewers options and let them choose one.
-Examples of buttons include upload buttons, submit buttons, image buttons, etc. These are used for page viewers to submit their responses or be taken to another page.


This work cycle was fun. I began by covering my meta elements and my document elements, and then started my body with a 'contact' heading where I would put the stores information. Below my contact heading i inserted a table to talk about the stores other locations, hours, and service hotline (some relevant information customers might want to know). Below the table I added a form where page viewers could put their name and leave any comments for the site, and then submit them for me to see.
