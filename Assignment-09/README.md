1. The universal selector is used to style every element on a page, the element selector is used to select all elements of a certain type, class selector is used to style elements, and ID selector allows developers to define style rules for a specific element by calling its unique ID.

2. I used an 80's color palette because I loved the neon colors of the 80's. I google searched for neon color html codes and found a great page with tons of options that I picked from. Codes: #FF355E, #50BFE6, #FF00CC, #FF9933.

3. My work cycle for this project relied heavily on the course website as it was important to learn the different selector types and figure out how to use them. I enjoyed learning how to use css and I think I will use it a lot. I also really enjoyed finding that website that has all of those codes for cool colors that I can copy and use in my coding now.
