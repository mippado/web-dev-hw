# Assignment 04

I went to the university of Montana's homepage on February 3rd, 2010. The website looked much more plain and one dimensional than it does today. I found it funny that on the homepage in 2010 they were promoting the University's new degree in environmental journalism, which now seems like it has been a staple degree here for a long time. The website today is much more colorful, using more pictures and graphics instead of just text.

I really like using the GIT module. It is much more logical for me to make my edits on Atom, then commit them straight to my website via the github desktop. I am curious however about how I can view my website pages through the gethub desktop so I can see how my edits look in real life.
